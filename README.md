# Ultrasonic-Insect-Repelent
This is a project where a 555 timner IC is used, with an speaker and power source to create an ultrasound that keeps irritateing insects and if you keep this system on inside a room then all the insects will go out of that room. 
This is very similar to a continious beep sound irritate human being if it keeps coming continiously so as being human we can either turn it of or escape from there. In the same way an ultrasonic sound wors for an insect, A schemsatic circuit diagram is mentioed in this project for reference.
